# TwoWayCrossedANOVA
 This package is for testing equality of treatment effects against ordered alternatives in two-way ANOVA model with interaction. This is for testing the hypotheses described in the article "Testing for Trend in Two-Way Crossed Effects Model under Heteroscedasticity".
 Suppose, you want to test for increasing simple effects of levels 1,2,...,a of factor A across the levels 1,2,...,b of factor B. Then arrange the data set in an excel sheet with a particular pattern, which is as follows. Take the observations Y_{ij1},Y_{ij2},\cdots ,Y_{ijn_{ij}} of cell (i,j) in the ((i-1)*b+j)-th column in an MSExcel sheet for i=1,2,... ,a; j=1,2,... ,b.  For more clarification, see the data-sets, named 'WPI_JWPB', 'RPSM_NKP' and 'Grades' inside the package 'TwoWayCrossedANOVA' in GitHub account 'AnjanaStat'.
To use the package in R software follow steps:
install_github("AnjanaStat/TwoWayCrossedANOVA") -> library(TwoWayCrossedANOVA). To use any of the functions, say, LRT, use LRT(data,a,b,alpha). For Min-Min-T and Min-Max-T tests corresponding functions are MinMinT(data,a,b,alpha) and MinMaxT(data,a,b,alpha) respectively.
